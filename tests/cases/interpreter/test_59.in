// This program relies on the fact that assignments return the assigned value
// And that the logical AND operator short-circuits
// So, when it encounters a falsy value, it wouldn't proceed to the subsequent assignments
// And then prints the assigned values
var a = "hello";
var b = "hello";
(a = true) and (b = false) and (a = "bad");
print a;
print b;
